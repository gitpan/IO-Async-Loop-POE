Revision history for IO-Async-Loop-POE

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Move all POE::Kernel-adjusting code into state functions to invoke
           directly, rather than building temporary closures
         * Updated for IO::Async 0.33
         * More unit tests on shared cooperation between POE

0.02    CHANGES:
         * IO::Async::LoopTests 0.32 no longer requires exact timing
           immediately after constructor, so no need for ->run_one_timeslice
           workaround

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
